# GPA Calculator
This personal project's objective is to convert a GPA calulator spreadsheet into a fully functional Windows Application. The goal of which is to simplify the grade calculation for University students.
This calculator allows the user to either calculate their percentage grade, letter grade and GPA for one course or multiple courses(up to 5). The calculator accounts for theory as well as lab grades allowing a student to calculate their theory or lab grade and notifying them if they pass both components. 
Finally the GPA's of each course card will be summed and the user will be presented with a term GPA. Users can also enter in their current CGPA and the application will determine their new current CGPA after calculation.
In the future I plan to add a function which will make a mock term transcript printing the results of the calculation to a file.

Key Features Include:
 - Simple UI for user friendliness and easy navigation.
 - Calculating hypothetical or actual single course grades even accounting for theory and lab components.
 - Calculating term TGPA by summing the GPAs of each course and dividing by the number of enabled courses.
 - Dynamically calculating TGPA as course grades are calculated and based on enabled courses accounting for courses that may be dropped.
 - Ability to dynamically edit data and only add to the CGPA calculation if the semester is saved.
 - Resetting the CGPA calculator and clearing all inputs.
 - Exporting one or both CGPA and TGPA data into a well structured text file for the user to keep record of.

FEATURES NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED YET:
 - Ability to upload the exported text file in order to fill out the course Scheduler.
KNOWN ISSUES:
 - Calculator does not resize properly for some smaller screen resolutions.
