# GPA Calculator
This personal project's objective is to convert a GPA calulator spreadsheet into a fully functional Windows Application. The goal of which is to simplify the grading process for University.
This calculator allows the user to either calculate their percentage grade, letter grade and GPA for one course or multiple courses(up to 5). The calculator accounts for theory as well as lab grades allowing a student to calculate their theory or lab grade and notifying them if they pass both components. 
Finally the GPA's of each course card will be summed and the user will be presented with a term GPA. Users can also enter in their current CGPA and the application will determine their new current CGPA after calculation.
In the future I plan to add a function which will make a mock term transcript printing the results of the calculation to a file.
